# Task-Scheduling-In-Multi-Core-Heterogeneous-Processor-A-Big.Little-Approach
Developed and implemented a task scheduling algorithm tailored for multi-core 
heterogeneous processors using the Big.Little architecture. The aim was to optimize 
performance and energy efficiency by appropriately distributing tasks between highperformance and power-efficient cores.
